## Describe the purpose:
This is our first project with the Coding Fundamentals course 04. Our project came as a solution for the factual communication issue within the Covid-19 pandemic under the circumstances of quarantine and hampering people activites outside home, where our needs for a virtual online learning increased.
Our goal is to make online education process easier by providing a user-friendly application. 

## Describe our site:
The main objective of the Online Learning Project is to help students go beyond traditional methods of learning and become familiar with the Internet where explanations of recorded material are readily available.
The implementation of this project helps students and teachers. Teachers can upload educational videos dealing with different topics on the application, and students can access these videos by searching within the section on the educational topic and paying the subscription fee.
We'll use the iPhone 6 / 7 / 8 Plus screen (with max-width:767px) in our project, and for easy access on a popular medium we'll make a responsive design for the tablet (min width: 786px) and (max-width: 1023px), and the desktop is wider than 1024px  .
The project uses html and CSS for front-end scripts.
